# Introduction
Google trends is an useful service to observe trends of web search keywords. You can use the service on the web, but I am a big fan of R. Thus, I decided to find R packages to access Google trends.

After my search, gtrendsR seems first choice. It's simple and easy to get Google trends info. Besides, It can plot trends line charts so quickly. I love this package.

I share my Rmarkdown example below.
